# CountBasis

Code used in 'Emulating computer models with high-dimensional count output'

General UQ/emulation functions are taken from (and updated at) https://github.com/JSalter90/UQ

The majority of emulators were fitted with hetGP. For the homoscedastic comparison (not in main paper), extra steps are required, with functions from https://github.com/BayesExeter/ExeterUQ required, and line 6 of `uq_code/Gasp.R` needs its path editing to point to these.

However, this is not particularly important.
